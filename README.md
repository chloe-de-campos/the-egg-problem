# the-egg-problem

**The Riddle**

You are given 12 eggs and told that 1 of them is a bad egg. Though the bad egg is visually identical to the other eggs, you know that its weight is marginally different than the weight of the other eggs. You have a balance scale which you may use 3 times to compare sets of eggs. How do you find the bad egg and determine whether it is heavier or lighter than the other eggs?

**The Website**

My tool provides riddlers with a drag-and-drop interface to explore possible approaches to the problem. The simulator secretly designates one bad egg. Users can practice weighing different combinations of eggs against eachother, with the results of each measurement recorded and displayed at the bottom. When a user thinks they've found the egg, they can check their results against the simulator.

**Other things**

This is the second draft of the site, designed to improve readability. Both drafts use html, css, javascript. 
I chose not to use external libraries like react.js as an exercise in javascript. But also, that makes the drag and drop interface super crude and unpleasant :D.
